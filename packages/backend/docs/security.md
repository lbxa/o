Password hashing is very important. As per OWASP recommendations:
> Use [Argon2id](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Password_Storage_Cheat_Sheet.html#argon2id) with a minimum configuration of 19 MiB of memory, an iteration count of 2, and 1 degree of parallelism.

The rest is up to users creating strong passwords.
